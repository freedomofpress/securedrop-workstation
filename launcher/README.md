# securedrop-workstation updater

The Updater ensures that the SecureDrop Workstation is up-to-date by checking for and applying any necessary VM updates, which may prompt a reboot.

## Running the Updater

To run the preflight updater:
1. Open a `dom0` terminal
2. Run `/opt/securedrop/launcher/sdw-launcher.py --skip-delta 0`

To run the notifier that pops up if `/proc/uptime` (how long the system has been on since its last restart) is greater than 30 seconds and `~/.securedrop_launcher/sdw-last-updated` (how long it's been since the Updater last ran) is greater than 5 days:
1. Open a `dom0` terminal
2. Run `/opt/securedrop/launcher/sdw-notify.py`

## Developer environment

Install the following packages in Debian Bullseye: `make`, `python3-venv`, `xvfb` and `python3-pyqt5`.

To run the preflight updater outside of `dom0`:

1. `cd securedrop-workstation/launcher`
2. `sudo apt install make python3-venv python3-pyqt5`
3. Set up your virtual environment by running `make venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Now you can run the updater: `./sdw-launcher.py` (it won't actually update VMs unless you are in `dom0`)
5. You can also run the notifier: `./sdw-notify.py`
6. And, finally, tests and linters by running: `sudo apt install xvfb`, then `make check`
